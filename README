ProjectSpectrum: 
  GOAL : 
    - Implement a complete & general spectrum generator for SUSY & non-SUSY models
    - Calculate some usefull observables such as the DM relic density, Anomal magnetic moment, ...
    - Implement usefull methods of scan by assuming constraints from observation :
        -- MCMC Algorithm
        -- Machine Learning Scan (MLS) method (see https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06615)

Note for myself : 
  - Compile C++ code with VS Code : 
    -- Add cpp files in tasks.json (if not present, F1 and "Tasks : Configure tasks")
    -- Compile code : Ctrl + MAJ + B
    -- Execute the program on terminal
